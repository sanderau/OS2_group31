Hey so this is the landing zone for a couple of humans trying to understand the arcane nature of the machine known as "linux".

We made a choice to put our LaTeX documentation in a separate directory, but in the same repository of the yocto based kernel.
This is the software equivalent of coding with an armed rat-trap next to your mouse. If you dont read what directory you are in, and type "make", you might break a finger.

We think it is important to practice the importance of typing words into the bash prompt of a linux based machine; especially when work done is with both human and machine langauges.

This is the story of Group 31's adventure with the linux kernel.
