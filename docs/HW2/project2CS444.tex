       \section{Introduction }
		 In this project, we were asked test the stability of the I/O elevators of the linux-yocto kernel \url(git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/linux-yocto/tree/drivers?id=v3.19.2). Instintively, we took turns testing a new elavating device with our body weight until it broke. 

		 The three main data structures that will be mentioned are Linked Lists, Queues, and Binary Search Trees.

		 This paper will first cover the functionality of an I/O elavator, and a few examples of modern input/output algorithms. 
		 Next, this paper will illuminate the current I/O elavator (FIFO NO-OP) that is in the file system specified above. 
		 With this information, our team will describe our experiences implementing the LOOK I/O Scheduler, and what to expect when swapping out the \textit(virtual) device that reads the input from your \textit(physical) device.

		 Concluding this paper is a synopis our what each member of our group worked on during this project, and how we felt about it.
