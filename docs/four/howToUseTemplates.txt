Hi team.


I used ' chmod 444 *' to change the permissions of the files to read only. 
This is so that we can reuse these files whenever we need to make a document.


The refs.bib have my sources for one of my other papers, so you can see what references look like. 

Ideally, we all add sources as we use them. That way, when we need to make a final paper, we can find our sources in constant time ( O(n) )
